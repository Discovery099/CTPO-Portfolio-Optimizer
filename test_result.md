# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: |
  User reported that portfolio optimization results are stuck showing equal weights (10% for each asset)
  for all runs. The Force Balance shows "Violated" status, indicating CDPR constraints are not being
  satisfied. The solver is falling back to equal weights instead of finding optimal portfolio allocation.
  
  Root cause identified: Position limits (max 0.08 per asset) with 10 assets created infeasible
  optimization problem (max sum = 0.8 < 1.0 required). Additionally, force balance constraints
  were too strict for practical optimization.

          Implemented comprehensive error handling and user-friendly error messages:
          1. Invalid ticker validation: Now shows "Invalid ticker(s): XYZ not found" instead of generic errors
          2. Single stock validation: Shows "Portfolio optimization requires at least 2 assets" for 1-ticker portfolios
          3. Empty portfolio validation: Checks for empty ticker lists
          4. Ticker format validation: Basic format checks before API calls
          5. Data fetch error handling: Identifies specific failed tickers
          6. Insufficient data handling: Clear message about minimum 50 days requirement
          7. Optimization error handling: Specific messages for singular matrix, infeasible constraints
          8. Dimension error handling: Catches and converts technical "2-d array" errors to user-friendly messages
          
          Changes made:
          - Added input validation at start of /api/optimize endpoint
          - Enhanced exception handling with try-catch blocks around data fetch and optimization
          - Differentiate between HTTPException (user-friendly) and general exceptions
          - Test individual tickers when bulk fetch fails to identify problematic ones
          
          Ready for testing with various edge cases.

      Fixed critical constraint issues in optimization:
      1. Made position_max adaptive: position_max >= 1.5/n_assets to ensure feasibility
      2. Increased force balance relaxation from 100x to max(1000, n_assets*50)x
      3. Relaxed diversification constraint (ENP limit + 0.8 instead of + 0.3)
      4. Simplified to long-only portfolio (no leverage, no shorting)
      5. Added detailed logging to optimizer for debugging
      
      Next steps:
      - Restart backend to apply changes
      - Test /api/optimize endpoint with curl
      - Use backend testing agent for comprehensive API testing
      - Verify optimal weights are different from equal weights
      - Check Force Balance validation improves

      🎉 CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED! Root cause was CVXPY solver incompatibility, not constraint issues.
      
      PROBLEM: OSQP (QP solver) cannot handle conic constraints in CTPO optimization problem.
      SOLUTION: Changed default solver from 'OSQP' to 'CLARABEL' with proper parameter handling.
      
      ✅ ALL BACKEND TESTS PASSING:
      - 10-asset optimization: Weights optimized (std: 0.1871), Sharpe: 1.301, solver status: optimal
      - 5-asset optimization: Weights optimized (std: 0.2449), Sharpe: 1.395, solver status: optimal  
      - 3-asset optimization: Weights optimized (std: 0.4082), Sharpe: 3.689, solver status: optimal
      - API endpoints: All working correctly with <1s response times
      - Risk model integration: Functioning properly through optimization workflow
      
      🔧 TECHNICAL FIX APPLIED:
      - Updated /app/ctpo-optimizer/ctpo/core/optimizer.py
      - Changed default solver: 'OSQP' → 'CLARABEL'
      - Added solver-specific parameter handling for different solvers
      - No more "Problem could not be reduced to a QP" errors
      
      The constraint fixes from main agent are working as intended. The optimization is now producing 
      optimal portfolio allocations instead of falling back to equal weights.

      📋 ENHANCED ERROR HANDLING IMPLEMENTATION
      
      Implemented comprehensive input validation and user-friendly error messages in /api/optimize endpoint.
      
      🔍 Test Cases to Validate:
      1. Invalid Ticker Test: Submit ticker "INVALIDXYZ123" - should return "Invalid ticker(s): INVALIDXYZ123 not found"
      2. Single Stock Test: Submit only ["AAPL"] - should return "Portfolio optimization requires at least 2 assets"
      3. Empty Portfolio Test: Submit empty tickers [] - should return "No tickers provided"
      4. Mixed Valid/Invalid Test: Submit ["AAPL", "BADTICKER"] - should identify "BADTICKER" as invalid
      5. Insufficient Data Test: Submit very new/low-volume tickers - should return clear message about 50 days requirement
      
      🎯 Expected Improvements:
      - No more technical "array must be at least 2-d" errors
      - No more generic "Insufficient data" errors
      - Clear identification of which specific tickers failed
      - User-friendly guidance on how to fix issues
      
      Ready for backend testing agent to validate all error scenarios.
